# WakeGuard

This alarm clock app for Android devices has a unique feature that helps ensure users really wake up. After the alarm goes off and the user dismisses it, the app starts monitoring the phone's movement. If the phone doesn't move for a set period of time, the app assumes that the user might have fallen back to sleep. To address this, the app is designed to sound the alarm again.

Before the alarm rings a second time, the app sends a notification 30 seconds ahead. This notification informs the user that no movement has been detected and that the alarm will go off again soon. This feature is especially helpful for those who have a habit of falling back asleep after turning off their alarm. It's a simple yet effective way to make sure users are fully awake.
