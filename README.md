# WakeGuard


Pending tasks: 


UPDATE 12/7: Just made a Pull Request, the alarm is 90% done. 
The alarm works great, the only remaining items are as follows: 

Items that I will work on: 

☐ Implement the alarm ring tone. We can either do just some default tone, or we can access he phone's list of ringtones

☐ Implement the Vibration switch in alarm Editor, switching off vibration should not make the alarm vibrate the phone.

☐ Deprecate the calendar icon in the AlarmEditorActivity. But keep the text to the left of it indicating when the alarm goes off. Center it though



Other items that are remaining:

☐ Low battery alarm switch implementation

☐ Follow Do Not Disturb implementation

☐ Notification Chime 1.5 mins before it goes off again
