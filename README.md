# WakeGuard


Pending tasks: 

☐ Notification-going-off Activity (The screen that appears to the user when the alarm goes off. A representation of this screen can be found in the Wireframe). 

☐ Settings Activity

☐ Alarm Notification



UPDATE 11/26: Nathan will take care of this. 
☐ Implementing alarm logic (alarm going off at the alarm’s set time). (Note that this will likely be split into different items, this bullet point involves MANY steps. As of now, we’re not completely sure of the scope of the steps. But we’ll find out as we dive deeper into the project)
