# WakeGuard


Pending tasks: 

☐ Benjamin: Implementing the settings of the Settings Activity (It is highly recommended to split these tasks among Ben and Vincent to ensure equal distribution of workload)



UPDATE 11/26: Nathan will take care of this. 

☐ Implementing alarm logic (alarm going off at the alarm’s set time). (Note that this will likely be split into different items, this bullet point involves MANY steps. As of now, we’re not completely sure of the scope of the steps. But we’ll find out as we dive deeper into the project)

☐ Alarm Notification
